		  <p>Phileas Fogg, a rich English gentleman, engages in a conversation with his partners at whist about the possibility of it. and this is what it leads to:
“I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes, that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes. Do you accept?”
And soon, Fogg is on the 8.45 p.m. train to Italy from London with his French servant, Passe-partout.
From trains to steamers to elephants, as Fogg travels across the four continents and different time zones, braving the unexpected, will he be able to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days?
Will Phileas Fogg win the bet?</p>
